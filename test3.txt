ADT Tree
Theory
- Definition (root is greater than anything else, etc)
- Vocabulary (parent, child, leaf, root, degree, depth, path...)
Traversals
- Pre-order
- Post-order
- Level-order

ADT Binary Search Tree
DEF -Binary (has no more than two children)
DEF -Search 
Operations:
- Contains, getMin, getMax, insert, remove

DS BSTree
contains()
getMin()
getMax()    ====    Source Code
insert()
remove()

ADT AVL-Trees
DEF
insert()
- single rotation
- double rotation
Binary Search Tree + Balance condition (difference between right and left tree's height is at most one)

Splay Tree
- Binary Search Tree that every contains() bubble up the leaf you're searching
- Good for stuff you don't wanna use very often

KD-Tree
- Multi-Dimentional Binary Search Tree

Heap Tree
- Binary Tree
- Heap: Every node is greater than its descendants (doesn't matter about repeated elements)
